# GaelDrive: Monte Carlo Localization for FTC

GaelDrive is a autonomous localization library for FTC that uses Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) to achieve the best possible autonomous cycles possible. 

Works with [Roadrunner](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner), a popular FTC autonomous navigation library, out of the box, but can work with any other autonomous library. 

Full installation releasing September 9th.
